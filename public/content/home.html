    Yes that's me. Or my online personality. Online one can find me nearly
    anywhere with that pseudonym. Try it out.

  <p><b>Stefan Reip</b></p>
  <p>That's my real name. I am a part time student at FH JOANNEUM. I study
    "<a target="_blank" href="https://fh-joanneum.at/ims">IT &amp; Mobile
      Security</a>" (master studies) at Kapfenberg. The other time I work as a
      software developer for web processes at <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.r-software.at/">Raiffeisen Software</a> in Leoben.

  <p><b>Coffee</b></p>
  <p>
    As a dev and student I am - of course - addicted to coffee.
    The so called Verl√§ngerte (long black (?)) is my favourite.
    Black without sugar. So if you want to make me happy, you can buy me one at
