  <p><b>Twitter</b></p>

    Est. 08/2009.<br>So one can say Twitter is my second home. If you would like to
    get in touch with me, drop a dm or tweet me. <br>
    Unfortunately, I lost access to my original account. So you need to use my
    new account <a href="https://twitter.com/5tousn">@5tousn</a>

    something usefull but you can find it at <a target="_blank"

    I like taking photos. Since I have my cam always with me I do it every day.
    Normaly, I use my Canon eos450d but it is so old it does not have W-LAN
    ("German" and better word for WiFi). So mostly phone pictures on

    Let's get the business done.<br>
    When I looked for an internship in 2016 I created my page on Xing.

  <p><b>Flickr</b></p>
  <p>
    Now to the serious pictures. Flickr is my place for that. From 2017 (and on)
    there is not much content online. This has to do with analogue photography.
    Of course my graddads old cam has no WiFi too. But have a look on your own
