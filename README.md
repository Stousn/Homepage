# stousn.at Homepage
Homepage located at [stousn.at](https://stousn.at)

## Purpose
A homepage of myself providing a business card

## Technologies
### VanillaJS
The SPA is self-written with plain JavaScript code.

### W3.CSS
A lightweight CSS Framework I use in most of my projects is [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/). My design is based on [W3.CSS Material Design](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_material.asp). W3.CSS is free to use. No license is necessary.

### GitHub Actions
I use a GitHub workflow to automatically deploy the masters head to firebase. The script for that purpose is located in this repo under [.github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/Stousn/Homepage/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)
